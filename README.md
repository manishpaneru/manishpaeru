# 👋 Hi, I’m Manish Paneru

### 🚀 Data Analyst | AI Builder | Founder @ Arnova Cognition

## 🌟 Who Am I?

Hey there! I’m Manish, a self-taught data analyst with a passion for turning raw numbers into powerful stories. I love coding in my unique style, building AI-powered tools, and seeing the world (and data) from a fresh perspective.

- 🎩 **Founder of [Arnova Cognition](https://www.arnovacognition.ai)**  
  Creating the future of AI SaaS, one idea at a time.
- 🤖 **Proud creator of Infosight** — an AI agent data analyst (but you won’t find my company’s products here; my GitHub is a playground for personal innovation).
- 💼 **Currently seeking new roles** as a data analyst, AI engineer, or anything where data + creativity = magic.
- 🧠 **Agentic AI enthusiast** — I love building intelligent agents that do more than just follow rules; they think, adapt, and surprise.

## 🧑‍💻 My Journey

From humble beginnings as a curious self-learner to founding my own AI company, my journey has been all about:
- **Learning by doing** (and sometimes by breaking things)
- **Building what I want to see in the world**
- **Finding beauty in chaos (and in messy datasets)**
- **Taking the road less traveled — and coding my own shortcuts**

---

## 🛠️ My Toolbox

### Languages & Tools
- **Python** — my main weapon of choice
- **SQL** — for when the data gets serious
- **Excel** — the classic that never lets you down
- **Power BI & Tableau** — for painting pictures with data
- **Streamlit** — building interactive apps with ease
- **Web Design** — because looks matter, even for analytics

### Data & AI
- **Agentic AI** — intelligent agents that go beyond the basics
- **Local LLMs** — privacy-first, on-device intelligence
- **Machine Learning** — predictive power, unleashed
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — where the magic starts

### Business & Analytics
- **Business Analysis** — connecting data to decisions
- **Analytics** — making sense of the noise
- **Mathematics** — the backbone of smart solutions

## 🧬 My Philosophy

> “Data isn’t just numbers — it’s a living story. And I’m here to read between the lines.”

- I believe in building tools that empower others to see what’s possible.
- I treat code as a canvas, not just a checklist.
- I’m always learning, always iterating, never satisfied with “good enough.”
- Sass isn’t just attitude; it’s confidence in my craft.

## 🦸‍♂️ Fun Facts & Sass

- 🥑 **Self-taught**: My “degree” is written in Python, not on paper.
- 🎨 **Data is my art**: I see patterns where others see noise.
- 🛠️ **Builder at heart**: If it doesn’t exist, I’ll make it (with style).
- 🤓 **Numbers never bore me** — but dashboards without color do!
- ⚡ **My superpower**: Turning “messy data” into “aha moments.”
